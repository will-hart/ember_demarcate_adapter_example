                <strong>NOTE:</strong>
                This demo is based on the "work in progress" demarcate.js 2.0 which 
                is currently only available on the 
                '<a href="https://github.com/will-hart/demarcate.js/tree/develop">develop</a>' 
                branch on github.  There may be some weirdness in the editor's behaviour :)

            <h1>Ember.js and Demarcate.js</h1>
            <p>
                This is a quick demonstration of the power of Ember.js to integrate with other
                javascript libraries and provide reusable interface elements in the form of
                <code>Views</code> and <code>Components</code>. The details of the implementation
                 are discussed <a href="http://www.williamhart.info/editing-markdown-with-emberjs.html">in a blog post</a>, but
                in short a view or component is converted into a demarcate.js
                editor, and the markdown is pushed into a bound property as you type.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can have a look at a demo of the 
                <a href="view/index.html">Ember.View based approach</a>
                or the 
                <a href="component/index.html">Ember.Component based approach</a>.
